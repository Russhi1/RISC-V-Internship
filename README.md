# SSSIHl_task1
 ### Week 1 

 We write a C program that adds number from 1 to 'n'.
* We first installed the leafpad editor if it was not previously installed.
* Then we write down our C code in the editor and save it as {filename.c} file.

### Code

```
# include <stdio.h.>

int main() {
    int i, sum= 0, n= 5;
    for (i=o; i<=n; ++i) {
    sum +=i;
    }
    printf("Sum of the numbers from 1 to %d is %d\n", n,sum);
    return 0;
}
```

* After saving the file we write down the command
` gcc {filename.c} `
` ./a.out`

Then we can just play with the numbers to get different outputs.

* We write another caommand
` risc
